Practice Korean
===============

I couldn't find a website on which to practice Korean, so I thought I'd make one!

I don't speak much Korean, so any help is welcome!

Hacking on this
---------------

Before you start, install [Harp](http://harpjs.com/docs/quick-start).

When developing, `harp server public` should be plenty.

To deploy, simply type `harp compile public www` in the main directory. `www/` will be full of all the needed files.
